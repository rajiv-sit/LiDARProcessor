[LiDAR]
; The lidar coordinate frame used here is a right-handed coordinate frame whose positive x-axis points in the direction corresponding to an azimuth of zero, 
; and whose positive z-axis points toward the top of the unit (away from the mounting plate). The yaw (called the "orientation" below), pitch, and roll angles 
; below describe the lidar orientation obtained as follows: Starting with the lidar axes aligned with the vehicle ISO axes, the lidar is first rotated around 
; the (common) z-axis by the yaw angle, then around the lidar y-axis by the pitch angle, and finally around the lidar x-axis by the roll angle. The pitch angle 
; is positive when the lidar x-axis is pointing slightly downward.
; Note the zero azimuth directions for common lidar units:
; VLP-16: zero azimuth is in the direction opposite of the cable.
; HDL-32: zero azimuth is in the direction 90 degrees counter-clockwise from the cable
; Alpha Prime: There are two molex connectors and four mounting holes. The zero azimuth direction is through the
; mounting hole on the opposite side of the connectors.
